### Implementing a client-server-architecture with mysql

A client-server architecture is a computing model that divides tasks between two types of specialized software: clients and servers. 

 In this architecture, clients request services or resources such as files (text, audio, video, etc.), databases, or applications from servers and these server fulfill the clients requests by returning an intended response (delivering the service or resource) back to the client.

 ### Components of a Client-Server-Architecture

A client could be a web browser, a mobile app, or any other software that needs access to resources that resides in a server. Clients are typically lightweight and are responsible for getting and presenting data to users in a user-friendly format.
